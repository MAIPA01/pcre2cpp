### **PCRE2 Exception**
Notwithstanding the above, you are permitted to link or otherwise combine this software with the PCRE2 library (or a modified version of that library), and distribute the resulting binaries without restriction, provided that you do not modify the PCRE2 library itself.

Furthermore, the second condition in the BSD license (covering binary redistributions) does not apply to software that includes this wrapper as part of a larger binary package, unless the package itself uses PCRE2 independently.
